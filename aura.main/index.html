  <h1>Forty Two</h1>
  
  <h2>What is Forty Two</h2>
  
  <p>We only focus on one thing: to give you a personalized retail experience. Today if you walked into store 10 times, few stores would have an idea of what you like as a customer. I only buy dress shirts, why am I getting emails about spring floral dresses?</p>
  
  <h2>Every customer cares about different things</h2>
  
  <p>Maybe you're someone who values being the first to know of new items, being notified of sales, or only getting suggestions for shirts that go well with your closet full of jeans. </p>
  
  <h2>Brave New "Retail" World</h2>
  
  <p><span class="tagline">Retail stores should function like eCommerce sites</span> Take everything you love about online retail and bring that offline. Now you have the best of both worlds: personal recommendations, and the touch and feel of the in-store experience. It's what your retail experience should be like. </p>
  
  <p><span class="tagline">Recommendations, just for you</span> We use a simple digital ID to identify your purchases. At checkout, the cashier will scan your ID barcode like any other item, and we'll send personalized recommendations that goes well with your purchases.</p>
  
  <h2>Are you a retailer</h2>
  
  <p>Forty Two's new enterprise platform is quick to set-up, and turns your most complex data into a simple, visual dashboard.  We work with some of the most innovative brands in retail. Send us a note, and we'll help you better understand your customers. </p>
